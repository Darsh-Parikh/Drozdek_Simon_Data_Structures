This was my first attempt. It creates a linked list at each index in an array, 
and then tries linking those lists back to back to back. The program in the 
outer folder is far better and also employs linking, just not in an as 
complicated way as here. While this program 'works', the delete function doesnt
work properly and leads to seg faults. Needs to be checked.
