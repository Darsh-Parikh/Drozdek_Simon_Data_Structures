Write a program that determines whetehr or not an input string is a palindrome, 
that is, whther or not it can be readt the same way forward and backward. At 
each point you can read only one character of the input string; do not use an 
array to syore this string and then analyze it (expect possibly in a stack 
implementation). Consider using multiple stacks.
