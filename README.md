This folder contains my attempts at excercises presented in the book
'Data Structures in C' by Adam Drozdek & Donald L. Simon
This was done somewhat early in the programming life, and so might have really 
bad code... It also contains code I transcribed because I was learning...

Stuff left to do:
1. Ch 2:
* MissionCannibal
* Smallest
2. Ch 5:
* AbstractedList
* Experiments :- listSorting.c
* SetList
3. Ch 6:
* Arithmetics
