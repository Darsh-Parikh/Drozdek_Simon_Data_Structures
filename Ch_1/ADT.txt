Abstractions through an ADT (Abstract data type) database

stuff the database always does:
1) int findRec(dbkeytype key, dbdatatype* data, indextype* idx);
    Looks up key in the simple database. If a record with that key exists, 
    findRec returns 1, data is teh data of the recod, and idx is an indicator 
    of where the record is stored. If not record is dound, then findRec returns 
    0, idx is an indicator of where the data should be put, and the data is 
    undefined.

2) int createRec(dbkeytype key, dbdatatype data, indextype idx);
    idx should indicate where the new record is to go.
    Adds a new record with key and data to hte simple database.
    Returns 1 for success, 0 for failure (databse is full).

3) void setRec(indextype idx, dbdatatype data);
    idx should indicate where the new recod should go.
    Changes the data of the record indicated by idx to be data.

4) void eachRec(void (*fn)(dbkeytype key, dbdatatype data));
    Applies the functon fn to each record (using key and data) in the database.
